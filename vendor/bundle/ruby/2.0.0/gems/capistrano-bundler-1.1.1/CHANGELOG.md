* ruby is not prefixed with `bundle exec` anymore by default
* prefix rails with `bundle exec` by default

# 1.1.0

* Switching to new command map (https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit/pull/45)
  Thanks to new command map, now this integration adds `bundle exec` to global executables (gem, ruby, rake). The list of executable can be tweaked by `bundle_bins`.

# 1.0.0
